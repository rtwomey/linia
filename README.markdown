About
=====
This script is designed to be a simple, self-contained (as much as possible) 
Perl script for gathering hardware information. System administrators often 
find it difficult to keep track of just what hardware is in which system. This 
script seeks to ease that burden.

System Requirements
===================
The get_inventory.pl script has not been extensively tested. I have used it 
for normal operations in a Linux computer lab (approx. 30 machines), as well 
as on my personal systems. I know it requires the following:

* Perl module Sys::Hostname
* That the lspci and uname commands be installed and in PATH
* That the /proc file system is used (requires /proc/meminfo, /proc/cpuinfo, and /proc/ide)

If you find the script to require additional system configuration items, 
please let me know (email rtwomey -AT- dracoware -DOT- com).

Included in this distribution are two non-standard Perl modules that are 
necessary for get_inventory.pl to run.  This makes installation much easier, 
as it doesn't require you put new modules into your Perl modules PATH.

I did not write these modules (and the LICENSE does not cover them).  I 
simply included them here to make installation easier.  Contact their authors 
if you have questions regarding their modules.
